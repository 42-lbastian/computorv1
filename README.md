<h2 id="description_id"> Description of the project: </h2>

The goal of this project is to write a program that solves a polynomial second or lower degree equation.

I print the delta if it's a sencond degree equation. It can also print complex solution. 

<h2 id="usage_id"> Usage: </h2>

#### Compilation: (in the folder that contain the makefile)
```shell
make
```

#### How to run it:

```shell
./computor "equation"
```

The equation must look like this: ``` "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0" ``` for example
